//The main method has all the tests and prints the maze in between testing:
    //default constructor
    //makeMaze
    //solveMaze

//Note:
    //if you do not add anything to the default constructor
    //invalid parameters
    //changing the startRow or endRow in between calls
//all of above will result in an unintended Checked Exception(this is how you break the program with it still running)

    //The order of completion goes clockwise starting with up
    //the last two parameters of the constructor and makeMaze method need to be < the first parameter
